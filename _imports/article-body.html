<p>They rooted on relish in the condiment race. They praised <a href="#" class="">right-hander Kyle Gibson</a> for navigating traffic throughout his five scoreless innings.

	<li><strong>All-time high ticket sales,</strong> with sold-out crowds at nearly all home games this season</li>
	<li><strong>First winning playoff</strong> record in 10 years</li>
	<li><strong>This</strong> was an unordered list</li>
</ul>

<p>All season, Kyle Bradish proved he was the Orioles’ most <a href="#">consistent and valuable starter.</a></p>
